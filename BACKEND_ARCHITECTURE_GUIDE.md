```

## Core Architecture

### 1. Application Factory Pattern
The application uses the factory pattern for flexible configuration:

```python
# server/__init__.py
def create_app(config_name='default'):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object(config[config_name])
    
    # Initialize extensions
    JWTManager(app)
    CORS(app)
    init_db(app)
    
    # Register blueprints
    register_blueprints(app)
    
    return app
```

### 2. Configuration Management
Environment-based configuration with development, testing, and production settings:

```python
# server/config.py
class Config:
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'dev-key')
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES = 86400  # 24 hours

class DevelopmentConfig(Config):
    DEBUG = True
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://localhost/agri_app_dev'

class ProductionConfig(Config):
    DEBUG = False
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
```

### 3. Database Layer
PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM, automatic table creation and migration support:

```python
# server/database.py
def init_db(app):
    db.init_app(app)
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
        create_initial_data()
```

## Data Models

## API Architecture

### Route Organization
Routes are organized by domain using Flask Blueprints:

```
/api/auth/*          # Authentication routes
/api/posts/*         # Article/post management
/api/communities/*   # Community features
/api/experts/*       # Expert consultation
/api/users/*         # User management
/api/admin/*         # Administrative functions
/api/payments/*      # Payment processing
/api/notifications/* # Notification system
```

### Controller Layer
Business logic is separated into controllers:

```python
# server/controllers/post_controller.py
class PostController:
    @staticmethod
    def create_post(data, user_id):
        # Business logic for post creation
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_posts(filters):
        # Business logic for post retrieval
```

### Service Layer
Complex business operations are handled by services:

```python
# server/services/notification_service.py
class NotificationService:
    @staticmethod
    def send_notification(user_id, message, type):
        # Notification sending logic
        
    @staticmethod
    def process_notification_queue():
        # Background notification processing
```
